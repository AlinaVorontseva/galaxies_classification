"cnr" is the file name
"kval" is one estimate of quality... about 1.5+ can be taken as threshold. Another method is to choose "popul" column binary values.
"varb" is a estimate of strength of bar, which is nuisance for modelling and can be used as extra parameter for machine learning. 
"dust" is indicator whether there is dust lane to be seen in image. 


In images, values are counts per second. It is common to look (and perhaps to model) images after you take log from each value (or add arbitary constant and take log).
